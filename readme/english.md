**A terminal inside a terminal? Why not?**
A shell sandbox made by our nation's children! 🇮🇩

## ❓ What is this?

**Termz** is *not* a real shell like `bash` or `zsh`.

It is a **sandboxed terminal environment**. This means that all file commands (such as `ls`, `cd`, `mkdir`, `rm`) that you run only apply within the `Termz/home` folder. It cannot damage or mess up your original system files.

It's very safe for tinkering, testing, or learning the command line without worry!

## ✨ Cool Features

* **100% Sandboxed**: All system file actions are *confined* to the `Termz/home` directory.
* **Built-in Package Manager**: Has its own `pkg install`, `pkg remove`, `pkg update`.
* **Flexible Package Repositories**: You can switch package sources (`trm change repo`), from the default GitHub repository to your own mirror.
* **Built-in Commands**: Basic commands like `ls`, `cd`, `mkdir`, `rm`, `rm -rf`, `clear`, and `exit` are already available.
* **Text Editor**: There is a `tre` command for editing files (using `nano` from your host system).
* **Ready-to-Use Git**: You can `git clone` directly inside the sandbox.
